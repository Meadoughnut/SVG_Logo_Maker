## Installation

To install and run SVG Logo Maker locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Meadoughnut/SVG_Logo_Maker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate** into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SVG_Logo_Maker
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use SVG Logo Maker:

1. **Run the application** using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts** to enter the text for the logo (up to 3 characters), select text color, choose a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and set the shape's color.

3. **Once all prompts are completed**, an SVG file named `examples.svg` will be generated in the root directory of the project.

4. **Open** `examples.svg` **in a web browser** to view the generated logo.

## File Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
.
├── examples/           # Directory for example SVG files generated by the application
├── lib/                # Directory containing shape classes and their tests
│   ├── shapes.js       # Definition of Circle, Triangle, and Square classes
│   └── shapes.test.js  # Jest tests for shape classes
├── .gitignore          # Specifies files and directories ignored by Git
├── index.js            # Main entry point of the Node.js application
├── package.json        # Project metadata, dependencies, and scripts
└── README.md           # Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines
```

## Testing

Unit tests for the shape classes (`Circle`, `Triangle`, and `Square`) are implemented using Jest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests ensure that each shape's `render` method generates the correct SVG string based on the specified color.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for application logic.
- **Inquirer**: Command-line interface library for user prompts.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework for unit testing.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface for generating SVG logos.
- Customizable text and shape options (text, text color, shape, shape color).
- Outputs SVG files that can be opened and displayed in web browsers.
- Modular code structure with unit tests to ensure reliability.
